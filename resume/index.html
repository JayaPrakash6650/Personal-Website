      <h3>Career Change</h3>
      <p class="career-change">
        The pandemic had affected millions of lives and mine is unfortunately one among them.
        What should've been a smooth journey through the campus placements in March 2020,
        was made a nightmare with the lockdowns issued by the state.
        We were forsaken by the companies that were scheduled to interview us.
        The university closed it's gates and took months (End of October to be exact) to finish our project viva.
        And to make matters worse the construction industry was in complete chaos.
        After almost half a year of fruitless searching, I decided to learn programming, and here is the result.
